  Here, we have another interactive stim board, this time with four panels. One can listen to a selection of synths from the above song 
  in addition to making their own music by pressing and holding the 'Flatulent sulking! Keep on pushin'' button while dragging one's cursor, watching a     circular display of one word from the song loop through a color gradient, take unique screenshot selfies, and use one's cursor to draw chaotically
  with a combination of lines and useful phrases attached.
